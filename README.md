# Generation-Of-Pn-Sequence-With-Internal-555-Timer-Based-Clock-Using-eSim-And-SKY130
# Abstract
This project focuses on the generation of Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequences utilizing an internal 555 timer-based clock system, implemented through eSim simulation software and SKY Water 130 nm technology. PN sequences play a crucial role in various communication and digital signal processing applications, including spread spectrum communication, encryption, and channel estimation. The proposed approach leverages the versatility of the 555 timer IC, a widely-used integrated circuit for timing applications, to generate PN sequences efficiently.
